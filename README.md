# Marginalen-Bank-AB

This project is done for the internship evaluation in Marginalen Bank AB.
It is done superficially and without details.
Due to some lack of required data and authorization, some parts of the codes are not completed.
It gives a partial picture about testers perspective and methodology.
In a broader time, it is normally possible to make the project perfect.
For the login part, as there is no created account, a negative test scenario is created with invalid credentials.
For creating a new account, the last step of the test is not completed in order not to create a real account.
Also it is possible to see the mind map belonging to "creating a new savings account" file.
