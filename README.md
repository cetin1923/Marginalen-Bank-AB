# Marginalen-Bank-AB

This project is done for internship evaluation in Marginalen Bank AB.

Due to some lack of required data and authorization, some parts of the codes are not completed.
It gives a partial picture about testers perspective and methodology.
In a broader time, it is normally possible to make the project perfect.
